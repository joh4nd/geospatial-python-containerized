# Geospatial Raster and Vector Data

I containerized the setup https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/geospatial-python/index.html for the Carpentries Incubator lesson for working with geospatial data in Jupyter Labs. Docker and bash are required.

Access the Geospatial Jupyterlab on http://127.0.0.1:8888/ in your browser. You may have to enter the token at the bottom of `$ docker logs geospatial-lab`.
