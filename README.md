# Geospatial Raster and Vector Data

I containerized the setup https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/geospatial-python/index.html for the Carpentries Incubator lesson about working with geospatial data in Jupyter Labs.

The Jupyterlab instance must be opened using the URL returned having run the docker commands in bash.

## Prerequisites
- docker
- bash
